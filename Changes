          - No significant (non-doc) changes. The version number was bumped
            automatically by Dist::Zilla as I was trying to force a new
            release.

          - Fix dependencies in the dist.ini file. This should resolve
            https://github.com/Ovid/Search-Typesense/issues/1

            right now, but it simplifies some common code.
          - Lay the groundwork for more i18n tests in the future.
